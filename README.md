# Frontend React Challenge With Node Rest API

## Prerequisites

To run the app locally you will need mongodb installed in advance. 

Enter the following commands to run the app
```
npm i
npm run start:mongodb
npm run start:server
npm start
```

## Useful Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
